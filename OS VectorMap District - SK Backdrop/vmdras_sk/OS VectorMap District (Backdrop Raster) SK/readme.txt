Tile Locator
------------

Your OS VectorMap District map data is supplied in 10km x 10km tiles. It can therefore be difficult to establish exactly which tile(s) you need to access to look at your area of interest.
To help you identify which tiles you will need to access, we have created a PDF document for each 100km tile of data in the National Grid showing the 10km tile grids on top. This will help you to quickly establish the tile(s) of data relevant to you.

This facility is provided at http://www.os.uk/business-and-government/help-and-support/products/tile-locator-maps.html.
